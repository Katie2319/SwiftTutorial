[Swift]

Swift is a general purpose language designed with an emphasis on safety, speed and expression. It is a compiled language developed by Apple with the purpose of developing iOS, OS X tvOS and watchOS applications. Swift is a multi-paradigm language, meaning it can support more than one programming paradigm. It is primarily an object-oriented language but it can also be written as functional, and uses tools of protocol-oriented programming. 


[History] 

Developed by Apple to be used with their operating system, Swift was designed in 2010 by Chris Lattner, along with Doug Gregor, John McCall, Ted Kremenk and Joe Groff.  Swift was introduced at Apples’s Worldwide Developers Conference in 2014 and is currently in version 4.2. 

[Usage]

Swift is most often used in development of products for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS and Linux . On “Swift.org”, the language is listed as being used “from systems programming, to mobile and desktop apps, scaling up to cloud services.” 

The most popular projects on Github using this language are:

1. https://github.com/justjavac/free-programming-books-zh_CN
2. https://github.com/apple/swift
3. https://github.com/vsouza/awesome-ios
4. https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire

[Resources]

For resources I intend to use the Swift community blog, which includes information about documentation(https://swift.org/documentation/). Apple hosts resources as well, which include documentation, sample code, and books (https://developer.apple.com/swift/resources/).  Java Point also has tutorial features and quick guides that will help with developing a basic understanding of the syntax of Swift (https://www.javatpoint.com/swift-introduction).
