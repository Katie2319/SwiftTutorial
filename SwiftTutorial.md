Swift Install and Hello World

Installation:

On a Mac device : 
•	In the App Store download Xcode. Swift can now be used within XCode and also from the command line/terminal 
On a Windows Device: 
•	Download Swift for Windows: https://swiftforwindows.github.io/ 
•	Use the compiler within the download to run Swift code
On a Linux device: 
•	Download a Swift package from:  https://swift.org/download/#using-downloads and follow instructions 

Writing Swift Code:

On a Mac the code can be written in the Xcode application, which is the recommended programming environment. Within the application there are several options. Creating a new project allows the coder to work on building an app or iOS application and the playground option gives the coder a sand box environment to develop code. Essentially the playground operates as a text editor. 

Swift code can be run from the playground by selecting the play button on the left hand side of the editor for specific lines or from the Editor menu at the top of the screen. Output should appear at the bottom of the application in the “Debug” or “Console” window. The panel on the right hand side of the application, or the “Results” sidebar, will show the results for each line of code in your program. 

Swift code can also be written in the Mac terminal. The command ‘swift’ should prompt a welcome window that then allows the user to write Swift code. Hitting the enter key then runs the program.

On a Windows machine, Swift code can be written in your favorite text editor, with the file saved as Filename.swift. In order to run the program, “Swift for Windows” has to be opened. Within “Swift for Windows” click “select file” and choose your file.  Then click “Compile”. Clicking “Run” will then run the program, with output in the command line.  

Swift does not require boiler-plate code, and the user is able to quickly get started coding. Working in the environments to develop more specific iOS applications can require more code in designing the software features. 

Hello World Program: 

In order to print the line “hello world” the code needed is: print (“hello world”) 

Comments:

Comments are written with a double back slash (//) and multiline comments are written as (/*comment*/).
